If I win, I will be happy. If I don’t, I won’t. It’s an if, then cause and effect, 
quid pro quo standard that we cannot sustain, because we immediately raise it 
every time we attain it. See, happiness demands a certain outcome. 
It is result reliant. And I say if happiness is what you’re after, 
then you’re going to be let down frequently and you’re going to be 
unhappy much of your time.

Joy, though, joy is a different thing. It’s something else. Joy is not a choice. 
It’s not a response to some result. It’s a constant. Joy is the feeling that 
we have from doing what we are fashioned to do, no matter the outcome.
